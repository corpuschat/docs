# Understanding AI-generated answers

## Corpus delivers AI answers on the public and private sources you trained it on.

Corpus utilizes OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT to comprehend customer inquiries, identify pertinent solutions in the Help Center, and deliver precise answers to customers based on those articles.

While we aim to offer precise and useful information in response to your questions, it is important to remember that Corpus is driven by machine learning models, which are not infallible. These models rely on statistical patterns, which means that they might occasionally produce an incorrect answer.

#### How can I have confidence in the accuracy of Corpus?

To ensure that your Corpus bot delivers the most accurate responses, we have implemented the following safeguards:

1. Answers are solely based on articles within the Help Center.
2. If the customer's question is unclear, it attempts to clarify the query.
3. If the bot cannot find an answer, it will admit that it couldn't locate a solution and can then transfer the conversation to a human.

Despite our efforts to offer accurate and useful information, it is essential to remember that Corpus is powered by machine learning models that are not perfect. These models are founded on statistical patterns and might occasionally yield incorrect responses.

We strive to enhance the accuracy of our model, but due to the nature of current AI models, they may occasionally provide an incorrect answer.
