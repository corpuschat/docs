## Subscription plans, billing, and client portal

Corpus has integrated Stripe, a leading online payment processing platform, to manage subscriptions and payments seamlessly. This document guides you through the billing and subscription management process for your Corpus account.

## Subscription plans

To understand the specifics of each plan's token allocation and features, refer to the <a href="https://app.corpus.chat/settings/billing" target="corpus-webapp">billing page</a> on the web app or explore the <a href="https://corpus.chat/pricing" target="pricing-page">pricing page</a> on our website.

## Subscription changes

Upon selecting a subscription plan, you'll be directed to Stripe's secure checkout page to complete your payment details, activating your subscription without delay.

Should you decide to upgrade your plan, payments will be prorated, ensuring you only pay for the difference based on the remaining time in your billing cycle.
