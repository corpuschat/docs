# The Home Screen
## The home screen encourages users to engage with your Chatbot by greeting them and allowing them to start a new chat with a single click

The home screen of the Corpus chatbot widget serves as the virtual front door to your customer support and engagement strategy. Thoughtfully designed to welcome users and prompt interaction, the home screen is a critical touchpoint that can significantly enhance the user experience.

### Customized Greeting

Leverage personalized greetings to establish an immediate connection with users:

- **Personalization Tokens:** Incorporate `{firstname|FALLBACK}` within your greeting message to dynamically insert the user's name, provided they are identified, which adds a personal touch to the welcome message.

### Pre-Defined Prompts for Quick Engagement

Facilitate immediate interaction by setting up pre-defined prompts:

- **One-Click Queries:** Curate a list of prompts that users can click on to start a conversation, streamlining their path to engagement.
- **Visible Cues:** These prompts are displayed even before the widget is opened, subtly encouraging users to engage with the chatbot.
