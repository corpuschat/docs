# Frequently Asked Questions

[[toggle Do you offer a free plan?]]
Yes, to some extent. Upon signing up, you’ll have one chatbot and 1,000 tokens to experiment with. This is usually enough to get a feel of the platform and see if it suits your needs.

[[toggle How can I provide Corpus with content related to my company?]]
Corpus pulls data from your website, Notion, GitHub, Intercom, HubSpot, ZenDesk, Google Drive, Confluence, RSS feed, and databases like Postgres and MySQL.

You can upload files in most formats, including PDFs, Markdown, MS Word/Excel, and more.
[[/toggle]]


[[toggle Is there a limit to how much content I can train a chatbot on?]]
This depends on your plan’s token credits. For example, the Indie plan provides 5M tokens, which is around 17M characters, or 150MB of data. Providing more content will enhance the chatbot’s ability to respond to queries accurately.

[[toggle What are Tokens?]]
Tokens are the fundamental units AI models use to calculate text length, consisting of groups of characters, including punctuation and emojis. As a general rule of thumb, one token is roughly equal to 3.3 characters of English text.
[[/toggle]]


[[toggle What defines a chatbot?]]
A chatbot refers to a project that contains content on a particular topic (i.e., your product), capable of replying to inquiries related to that data.

While you can place chatbots anywhere on your website, you may need chatbots with different knowledge sets for different purposes (for example, one to answer pre-sales questions on your landing page, and another inside your app to provide support for your product).

[[toggle What is the user limit for my chatbot?]]
We do not impose any restrictions on the number of people who can interact with your chatbots. Once on your website, all visitors can interact with it.
[[/toggle]]


[[toggle How long does it take to train the chatbot?]]
Training time varies based on the number of pages used, but it typically takes just a few minutes.
[[/toggle]]


[[toggle Can I re-train my chatbot automatically when I update the content?]]
Absolutely! We offer an API endpoint you can use whenever your content grows or changes. Add it to your content release workflow or use it in a GitHub action to keep your chatbot up to date.
[[/toggle]]


[[toggle Do Corpus work with non-English content?]]
Yes. Corpus can understand and respond in several languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Arabic, and Chinese, with more languages coming soon.
[[/toggle]]


[[toggle What happens when the chatbot can’t answer a question?]]
To ensure accuracy, Corpus delivers answers derived exclusively from your content.

If it cannot locate the appropriate response, it will inform the user and recommend contacting to you via the contact form available within the widget.
[[/toggle]]


[[toggle Can I use Corpus to help my users with programming questions?]]
Yes. Corpus understands and can provide code examples (if your content has any) in Python, JavaScript, C/C++, C#, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Swift, TypeScript, SQL, and even Shell.
[[/toggle]]


[[toggle Do unused token credits roll over to subsequent months?]]
No. Token credits do not roll over. Furthermore, if you cancel your subscription, unused token credits will expire at the end of the last paid cycle, based on your plan’s date of purchase.
[[/toggle]]


[[toggle Can I access chat history to see user interaction?]]
Absolutely! You can access all user interactions with your chatbots, including the entire chat history.

We will soon launch an <span class="font-semibold">insights dashboard</span> for additional chatbot performance metrics, such as common and unanswered questions.
[[/toggle]]


[[toggle How do I add chatbots to my website?]]
You can easily integrate the chatbot widget into your website with a compact JavaScript snippet. Additionally, each chatbot comes a unique URL, which you can directly link to as needed.
[[/toggle]]


[[toggle Is the chatbot widget customizable?]]
Like you wouldn’t believe :) You can modify the bot’s colors, avatar, name, suggestions, welcome messages — even its personality!
