# Training Chatbot on Custom Data
## Equip your chatbot with business-specific intelligence through custom training

Training is a fundamental process in the realm of artificial intelligence, especially when it comes to chatbots. It involves feeding the AI model with relevant data, allowing it to learn and subsequently generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses. Think of it as educating a new employee on your company's knowledge base so they can perform their role effectively.

### Custom Data Integration

- **File Uploads:** Easily add knowledge by uploading documents, including MS Office files, PDFs, and more.
- **App Creation:** Directly craft documents within the app, tailoring information to your needs.
- **Web Fetching:** Automatically pull data from your website or online materials for the chatbot to learn.
- **External Sources Connection:** Link to a myriad of platforms such as Notion, GitHub, YouTube, Google Drive, HubSpot, Intercom, Zendesk, and SQL databases to enrich the chatbot's knowledge pool.
